```console
git clone https://github.com/tasts-robots/upkie_locomotion.git
cd upkie_locomotion
./tools/bazelisk run -c opt //agents/blue_balancer:bullet
```

Connect a USB controller to move the robot around. ðŸŽ®

There is no dependency to install on Linux thanks to [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), which builds all dependencies and runs the Python controller in one go. (This will take a while the first time.) The syntax is the same to deploy to the Raspberry Pi of the living-room version of the robot.

## Contents

### Agents

* **Blue balancer:** ...
* **Pink balancer:** same as the Blue balancer, but inverse kinematics is computed by [Pink](https://github.com/tasts-robots/pink) rather than by a model-specific analytical solution. This is the controller that runs in the [first](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8b36XcCgh7s) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO_TkHGS0wQ) videos of Upkie.

### Spines
