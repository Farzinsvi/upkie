/*! Floating base odometry from wheel measurements.
 *
 * We can use a simple rigid body for each wheel. In the base frame:
 *
 *    [ v_i.x ]     [ v.x ]     [   0   ]     [ r_i.x ]
 *    [ v_i.y ] =   [ v.y ] +   [   0   ] x   [ r_i.y ] + B_dot(r_i)
 *  B_[ v_i.z ]   B_[  0  ]   B_[ omega ]   B_[   0   ]
 *
 * where v_i is the linear velocity of the wheel point, v the linear velocity
 * of the base, omega its angular velocity, r_i the position of the wheel point
 * and dot(r_i) its time derivative (e.g. if the leg is moving).
 *
 * When we infer all these equations should be satisfied simultaneously. The
 * system is over-determined so we can do it in a least-squares sense.
 *
 * In this implementation, we assume omega and dot(r_i) are zero, so that it
 * all simplifies to:
 *
 *    [ v_i.x ] =   [ v.x ]
 *  B_[ v_i.y ]   B_[ v.y ]
 *
 * And we simply compute v from v_i's with an arithmetic average.
 *
 * \note Odometry is only incremented when at least one wheel is in contact
 * with the ground.
