        Equivalently, angle from the heading vector to the sagittal vector of
        the frame.

        Angle is positive in the trigonometric sense (CCW positive, CW
        negative) in the heading-vertical plane directed by the lateral vector,
        which is ``(x)`` in the above schematic (pointing away) and not ``(.)``
        (poiting from screen to the reader).
